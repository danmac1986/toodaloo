        <h2>Plans and Progress</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Story of our project - how it began:</strong> As we began our planning process for this project, we as a team wanted to address an everyday problem, for which we will be able to create an efficient solution for. And so after much deliberation and multiple ideas, we decided we want to  be able to create a program that will make the lives of those around us easier, even if it were to be a small issue. And that is how this idea was born and this project came to be. An annoying yet serious issue that tends to affect every member of our global society as a whole, is a lack of cataloguing for restrooms across cities, and added to this, is the poor signage and vague directions which makes it especially difficult for tourists and newcomers to navigate and find. We wish to resolve this issue. In this digital age, where the solution to most problems is within your fingertips, we have created a stress-free alternative, in order to completely erase this hassle from our lives and eliminate the undue stress it may induce on fellow travellers who wish to explore Melbourne city without worrying about what they may do when nature strikes as they adventure around, or worse have a disaster strike like a scene from the film Bridesmaid. And so we have come up with the perfect solution to all such disturbing worries one may have,an easy to use and convenient smart program, our  app TooDoLoo. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Our goal is to create an app, TooDoLoo,  that will categorically list all public and venue restrooms, with special features that will make finding a toilet in the middle of an unfamiliar city, a worry of the past. We aim to list restrooms within the key CBD areas of Melbourne, and in the future of all cities around the world. </p>
        <br>
        <p>We all have heard of horror stories of what happens when someone we know was struck with the worst of luck, and that along with confusing signage, a lack of clear direction, and general unawareness has led to quite some embarrassing moments. All of which could have easily been avoided had they had access to ToDaLoo. Our app, in addition to indexing restrooms around the city, will also provide a clear, easy to understand, guided navigation to the user’s closest restroom, using Maps SDK.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Added to this we plan to provide users with a review page that may be found along with the navigational details, that utilise user input on useability and approvability on a list of set markers that assess on cleanliness, accessibility, general appearance, and any important features such as baby changing rooms and wheelchair accessibility. The reason for this is quite simple. So that people can find the best facilities near them that meet all their needs. </p>
		<br>
        <p>Furthermore, when thinking of restrooms, a key feature that felt vital for this app was user reviews.Within ToDaLoo, we aim to provide users with a platform to present their reviews of all toilets, based on a list of criteria markers, such as cleanliness, waiting time, and other vital resources that are crucial attributes like baby changing tables, wheelchair accessibility and even shower rooms. With these essentials addressed, ToDaLoo will  help users have a stress free affair, particularly when they need it most. </p>
		<br>
        <p>At present we have approximately calculated the time needed for us to have a functioning single platform application to be about 512 hours  for the basic development stage, with an addition of 110 hours to add in the modules required for user review management. Under the current conditions, a potential setback we  could face would be that this technology may not be used as currently no tourists are arriving into Melbourne and due to the strict lockdown laws, not many people from outside the city are also coming into the CBD for activities such as clubbing or night outs.</p>
		<br>
        <p>Over the past 10 weeks we have broken our development progress down into 6 stages or steps for our Android App. We wanted to not only show the progressive infrastructure of the application development but also wanted to show our train of thought, methodology and processes involved.</p>
		<br>
        <p><strong>Strategy – first 2 weeks of our development process</strong><br>
		Our first phase of the mobile app development was defining our strategy for evolving our idea into a successful app. We wanted our apps to differ from the others however still have an impact on our users.
		We identified the app users, researched our competition, established our goals and selected our platform for the app.
		Furthermore, we established where we would go once it had launched and where we wanted it to be once it was gaining traction.
		</p>
		<br>
        <p><strong>Analysis and Planning – week 3 and 4 of our development process</strong><br>
		Our app has started to take shape, turning into an actual project. Here, we captured detailed functional requirements and prepared a product roadmap. We identified the requirements for the app and prioritized the app required and generated milestones.
		As part of the planning phase, we identified what we would require in terms of languages for our building the application for Android. We identified that Java was required for our app and that most of the apps in the play store are using the same language.
		We developed a name and had to ensure that not only was the name available for the play stores, but also as a domain name, iOS, Facebook and Instagram. This is to ensure that we not only have a secure name, but we would keep the name uniform among all the platforms.</p>
		<br>
        <p><strong>UI/UX Design – weeks 5 and 6 of the development process.</strong><br>
		We wanted to ensure that our design would deliver a seamless and effortless user experience whilst possessing a polished look and feel.
		We understand that the success of the mobile app is determined by how well the user adapts and benefits from the features.
		Our goal was to ensure that not only would it look and feel like a well-built app but to make the user experience interactive, insightful and user friendly, as the user experience is at the most imperative component to keep the users engaged.
		In order to get to this stage, we had to determine what data we required for the mobile app, what was generated by the app and what was data collected from the user, along with the user interactions and the users journey from within the app.
		We wanted to ensure that we have a better understanding of the conceptual layout. We drew up digital wireframes for the aesthetics and user experience. From here we decided on colours, design, branding, layout as we believe that being established early on as part of our process,  that it would improve not only our productivity but also give us guidelines and help with the app’s look and feel.
		For creating a prototype of our app, we decided that invisionapp.com was our best bet, allowing our product design to create the experience. We thought this would be the most favorable solution as we did not need to spend time on creativity and  design  and as it allows us to create an experience that feels real, without any code and will not compromise to design or development.
		During the prototyping stage, we were able to review the app's functionality and were able to make changes where needed</p>
		<br>
        <p><strong>App Development – weeks 7 – 9 of the development process.</strong><br>
		This will be the most challenging part of the progress in our mobile app, we will have to adapt our plans as this is the most integral part of the whole development (you can’t have an app without the development). We would need to re-define the development milestones as what we had planned wasn’t realistic.
		A team of 4, wanting Android and iOS, in a maximum of 15 weeks! We will need to make a decision, although Android applications can take 30% longer, we will probably decide that our combined skills would allow us to flourish in an Android app. With over 3 billion active Android devices, and 1 billion active Apple devices, we will choose to go with the biggest market. We would possibly choose this as not only would the market be bigger in Android for release, but we could always bring out iOS capabilities at a later stage.
		At that stage we would use Node.js for our development, although it is not as stable as PHP, Node.js has very high performance indicators and in some of those indicators outperforms PHP.
		With Node.js being our framework for the app, we can use any API, however we imagine that an Express Model View Controller would be the best option for our mobile application for not only its speed but also the massive community and its ease of access to secure support should we need it. We are currently hosting on a Linux, Windows or Mac server in order for Node.js to operate.
		As we are storing data, our decision shall be to go with PostgreSQL, as not only is it an open source database, it has a strong reputation along with performance and is filled with useful, quality features. We also plan to execute in this SQL because it comes with a strong community and clear official documentation for support.
		In terms of our front end technology, we would opt for our android mobile app to be developed in Java via Android Studio.</p>		
		<br>
        <p><strong>Testing – week 10 of the development process.</strong><br>
		We would have to go through rigorous testing to ensure that our Android App is modern, user friendly and that our tests were not only targeted towards the final implementation but also user experience,visuals and workflow. We plan to ensure that we have consistent fonts, attractive colour scheme, easy navigation, modern and appealing design.
		In order to be a success, we will make certain that the functionality of the Android App is essential. We understand that we can not predict our user’s behavior and usage so we have had to think of possible scenarios where our user may become frustrated, such as performance issues, user requests, draining device battery, network bandwidth, etc.
		Our greatest concern for our app has been with security testing and any potential vulnerabilities which may lead to an attack. As our users can login with social media, we are using SSL which encrypts the communication between our users and the server. Due to the fact that our app offers users input and submissions, along with username and passwords we aim to implement third party tools such as LastPass, which allows us to store sensitive information should there be an attack.
		Device and platform testing will take place in week 10, it's not uncommon for a new device to be released every 12 months, this includes but not limited to hardware, firmware and design. While the operating systems on average have updates every few months.
		We will need to make sure that our Android App would operate on manufacturers like Samsung, HTC, LG, etc. Although they customise the platform for each manufacturer, Android is open source. Comparing this to Apple which is controlled both hardware and software by the single source, Apple.
		We also plan to exercise an extensive testing strategy as this is vital to the app's future and have decided to go for an Over The Air installs.</p>		
		<br>
        <p><strong>Deployment – week 11 of the development process.</strong><br>
		It will now be ready for deployment.
		After 11 challenging weeks of intense planning, coding and problematical equations that would need to be resolved. However, at this stage we would be about to release our creation to the Google Play store. Where the general public could download and become our clients. 7 billion people in the world, and our creation catering to all.
		It will not stop here, after submitting to the play store, we will need to review and monitor the usage, oversee the analytics and track KPI’s. Meaning the app and frequently checking for user issue reports or crash reports.
		We encourage our users to provide feedback within the app, along with their suggestions. This is where we work promptly to ensure our end users are seeing their suggestions and feedback being updated, patching with improvements. This not only ensures our end users are engaged but gives them confidence that we are working with them to make our creation about them, the end user.
		This is an ongoing process and will continue to receive user feedback and build additional functionalities. We put our users first, to ensure that they keep using our service. </p>		
		<br>
        <p>Added to this we plan to provide users with a review page that may be found along with the navigational details, that utilise user input on useability and approvability on a list of set markers that assess on cleanliness, accessibility, general appearance, and any important features such as baby changing rooms and wheelchair accessibility. The reason for this is quite simple. So that people can find the best facilities near them that meet all their needs. </p>
