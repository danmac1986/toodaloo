            <p>I am Priya Mathew, currently I am studying at RMIT and my student ID is s3925824 and my email id is: s3925824@student.rmit.edu.au. A curious fascination of mine has been the digital world I am an active participant in. I have always been intrigued by how efficiently and effectively the world of IT works, and wished to be an active contributor to it. The idea of data analytics, especially of how the everyday data that has been collected “voluntarily” from customers, like me through our daily interactions online, is then being used by large and small enterprises to determine marketing strategies, research policies and even develop prediction softwares that can accurately analyse how we will vote. This curiosity has led me to seek out  a career in IT, and has also influenced my approach to IT, and has been the key determinant in cultivating my interest in pursuing this subject academically, even though I only possess limited prior experience with Information Technology overall.</p>

            <p>My interest in IT started from high school. IT start-ups were a thing and I was told jobs related to IT have good prospects for future. Also I watched a comedy drama named Silicon Valley which is about five programmers struggling in Silicon Valley. It not only made me laugh a lot but also gave a basic information about starting IT based business and living in Silicon Valley. My current interests in IT are regarding clouds, data, IoT and Quality Assurance and I expect my future job to be related to them.

            <p>I’m Dan, I’m 36 and live in Williamstown Victoria, S3921231@student.rmit.edu.au. I haven’t studied since high school of 2005, so this transition has not only been a learning experience but also has been overwhelming to get back into studying and the workload required. However, in saying that I feel this will not only be a positive experience but also a good chance to gain new skills.
I’m a lover of dogs, and cooking.
I’ve always been capable of IT and my interest started since before I can remember. My first computer was before the age 5, playing computer games in dos. Although I don’t possess any formal IT training, I’ve been self-taught on what I do know.
I decided to study with RMIT as it’s a technology-based university which has a good reputation, furthermore, RMIT relationships with leading industry companies for placements and experience.
I’m interested in learning the web side of IT and gaining experience in web design and mobile applications as I believe they are the future.
